### Overview
A dice game where the objective is to roll 10 dices that are all the same number.

To play the game, start by clicking on any dice to "hold" it. When you click the "Roll" button, the held dice won't change its value. Keep rolling and holding the dice with the same number until all 10 dice display the same number.

Once you hold the last dice with the same number as the rest, you've achieved "Tenzies"!

### App Feature
 - Users can roll 10 dices simultaneously by clicking a "Roll" button.
 - Users can click on individual dices to hold them. Held dices will not change their value when the user clicks the "Roll" button again.
 - Dices that are held can be visually distinguished as their color changes to green, making it clear which dices the user has chosen to hold.
 - Users have the option to reset the game and start over if they wish to play again.
 - When all rolled dices have the same number and the user holds the last dice, a success notification appears congratulating the user for achieving "Tenzies". This notification is accompanied with confetti animation to enhance the celebration.
 - Display the number of rolls it took the user to achieve "Tenzies".
